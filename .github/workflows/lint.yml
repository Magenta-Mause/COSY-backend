    steps:
      # 1. Check out the code
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Set up Java
      - name: Set up JDK 21
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '21'
          distribution: 'temurin'
          cache: 'maven' # Caches dependencies to speed up future runs

      # 3. Check Code Formatting (Spotless)
      # This step will FAIL if the code is not formatted correctly.
      # It ensures no "ugly" code gets merged.
      - name: Check Formatting (Spotless)
        run: mvn spotless:check

      # 4. (Optional) Run Static Analysis (Checkstyle)
      # Uncomment the line below if you added the maven-checkstyle-plugin
      # - name: Run Checkstyle
      #   run: mvn checkstyle:check

      # 5. Build and Test
      # This ensures the code actually compiles and unit tests pass.
      # 'verify' typically runs integration tests and other checks too.

        run: mvn verify -DskipTests=false
